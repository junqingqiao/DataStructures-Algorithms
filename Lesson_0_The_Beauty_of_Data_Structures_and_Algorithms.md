### Let's start with an example 



Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.
**Example 1:**
**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,1\]
**Output:** true
**Example 2:**
**Input:** nums = \[1,2,3,4\]
**Output:** false
**Example 3:**
**Input:** nums = \[1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2\]
**Output:** true
**Constraints:**
 - `1 <= nums.length <= 10<sup>5</sup>`
 - `-10<sup>9</sup> <= nums[i] <= 10<sup>9</sup>`



## Basic Data Structures

| Data Structure | Description | Operations |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Array | A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations. | Access, Search, Insert, Delete |
| Linked List | A sequence of elements, where each element points to the next one in memory. | Access (sequential only), Search, Insert, Delete |
| Stack | A collection of elements with Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) order. | Push, Pop, Peek |
| Queue | A collection of elements with First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order. | Enqueue, Dequeue, Peek |
| Hash Table | A collection of key-value pairs, where keys are hashed to provide quick access to values. | Insert, Delete, Search |
| Tree | A hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges. | Search, Insert, Delete, Traversal |
| Heap | A specialized tree-based data structure where the parent nodes are greater (or lesser) than their children. | Insert, Delete (min or max), Peek |
| Graph | A collection of nodes (vertices) and edges connecting them. | Traversal, Search, Pathfinding |
